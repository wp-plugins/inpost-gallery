== Description ==

Powerful and very pleasant photo gallery plugin to work with images in WordPress.
5 galleries in one plugin. Do not read documentations - install and use! 
Unique functionality: Each gallery can be presented on the page as one clickable image!!!
Insert such little image in any widget, and your customers will be able to watch big galleries by one click!

The Backend is powered with visual shortcodes management where you only by mouse can change view of your post gallery on front.
You do not need go to another pages with amount of options. 

Just install and use, all you need it is popup with shortcode options in your current page editor.

Good for photographers and portfolios.

Supports: multiple images uploading, css effects (like round corners of images with shadow).
